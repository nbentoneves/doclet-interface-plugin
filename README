# Introduction
------
The goal of this plugin is to generate a html page where you can see the documentation method (name of method, input parameters, output parameters, etc) allowing you call the methods and injecting an json input and receive a json output.

In the first phase we only have available the documentation part, you can't perform requests to the methods. We will have the following features in the following order:

1. HTML page with method documentation. (Only available for one method) :heavy_check_mark:
2. You can perform a request to method (Only available for one method) :soon:
3. You can have a html page with multiple methods documentation and can perform a request for each one. :soon:
