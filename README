# Introduction
------
The goal of this plugin is to generate a html page where you can see the documentation method (name of method, input parameters, output parameters, etc) allowing you to call the methods and injecting an json input and receive a json output.

In the first phase you only can configure for one method and using primitive data type. We will have the following features in the following order:

1. HTML page with method documentation. :heavy_check_mark:
2. You can perform a request to one method. :heavy_check_mark:
3. You can perform a request to method with non primitive data types. :soon:
3. You can have a html page with multiple methods documentation and can perform a request for each one. :soon:
